## How to use

1. **Create a new issue**

   - Open a new issue in this repository
   - Write your question or message in the issue title
   - The workflow will automatically respond using the default model (GPT-4.1)

2. **Continue the conversation**

   - Reply to the AI's response in the issue comments
   - The AI will maintain context of the entire conversation
   - Each response will be from the same AI model

3. **Change the AI model**

   - Add a label with the model ID you want to use (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o`)
   - The next response will use the selected model
   - Available models are listed as labels in the repository

4. **Update available models**
   - Comment "update labels" in any issue
   - The workflow will refresh the available model labels
   - You'll get a confirmation with the list of current models

## Available models

The workflow supports all models available in the GitHub AI catalog, including:

- `openai/gpt-4.1` (default) - Latest GPT-4 model with improved performance
- `openai/gpt-4o` - OpenAI's multimodal model
- `openai/o1` - Advanced reasoning model
- `openai/o3` - Enhanced quality and safety model
- And many more...

To see all available models, see the [repository labels](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/chat/labels) or the [official API endpoint](https://models.github.ai/catalog/models).

## How it works

1. When you create an issue or comment, the workflow:

   - Checks for a model label
   - Uses the default model if no label is found
   - Maintains conversation history
   - Generates a response using the selected model

2. The workflow automatically:
   - Creates labels for all available models
   - Maintains consistent label styling
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Provides helpful error messages
